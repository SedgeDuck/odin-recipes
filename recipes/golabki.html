    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Along with pierogi, these cabbage rolls/golabki are dear to my heart. I
      try to always make them during the holiday season to stave off winter
      depression. You can also substitute the ground beef 1:1 for Impossible
      sausage, and oat milk for milk.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1 head cabbage</li>
