      <h2>Description</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      My mom used to always make pierogi and cabbage rolls (golabki) every year
      for Christmas. A lot has changed since I was a kid, but I'll always love
      the gift of still getting to share these little pan-fried cheesy potato
      dumplings with the people I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> you can substitute vegan cheese, butter, oatmilk,
      and sour cream for the dairy products -- they're delicious either way! I'm
      still working on the best alternative for normal bacon pieces.

      <h2>Method</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix all ingredients into a dough and knead well.</li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into four balls and let rest in a covered bowl for 30 min.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mash together potato, butter, and garlic.</li>
      <li>
        Add milk until potatoes are creamy but still hold their shape when
        rolled between hands.
      </li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Let cool until room temp, then mix in shredded cheese to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Putting it together:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Roll dough out on a floured board and cut into circles.</li>
      <li>
        Put filling, rolled into a football shape, on dough round. Fold dough
        over filling. Seal edges with a fork, using a bit of water in between as
        necessary, being careful not to puncture into filled portion of pierog.
      </li>

        Boil pierogi in salted water until they float, then pan fry in
        bacon-onion grease and butter until each side is golden brown.
