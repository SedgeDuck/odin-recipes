      <h2>Description</h2>
    </div>
    <p>it's lasagna! it's vegan! and somehow it tastes really good???</p>

    <p>
      we're not even vegan... and my fiance really doesn't like lasagna or most
      pasta dishes, so the fact they went back for thirds is pretty rad. If you
      don't want it vegan, you can just substitute ground beef and real cheeses,
      but it actually turned out really well.

      <h2>Method</h2>
    </div>    
    
    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Saute onion and garlic in olive oil with a pinch of salt until onion is
        softened (not caramelized).
      </li>
      <li>Add sausage and cook until evenly browned.</li>
      <li>Stir in tomato paste until sausage is evenly coated.</li>
      <li>Add tomato sauce, reduce, add crushed tomato.</li>
      <li>
        Add one paste can + one sauce can's worth of almond milk, as well as one
        crushed tomato can's worth of half oat and almond milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add seasonings to taste (more than you think you'll need of each!) and
        reduce slightly. Salt to taste, set sauce aside.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the noodles:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil in well-salted (like the sea!) water 4-5 minutes, until just barely
        flexible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer between parchment paper to keep from sticking together, set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Putting it together:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Lightly oil a 9"x13" glass baking pan.</li>
      <li>
        Make 4 layers, repeating in order:
        <ol>
          <li>1.5 cup sauce</li>
          <li>Eggplant rounds, evenly spaced</li>
          <li>Thin layer arugula</li>
          <li>Noodles, trimmed so as to not overlap</li>
          <li>Feta and mozzarella</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Top with 1.5 cup sauce and all cheeses (incl. parm)</li>
      <li>
        Cover with foil and <strong>bake</strong> at 325&#xb0; F for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise temp to 425&#xb0; F. Remove foil and bake ~10 min, until cheese is
        melted and top is golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Let stand 10 min to set; cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>
